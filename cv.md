## Previous employment

### Spirit Pub Company

I have been a team leader at two Spirit pubs, the Thatched House and the Encore.

The Thatched House is a food-led establishment known as a family pub. Here I focused on bar training for the team and stock management. Ensuring compliance with relevant public safety legislation was also a responsibility. I achieved several 100% mystery guest visits on my shifts. With my help, the team focused on sales and guest satisfaction.

At the Encore, a drink-led pub with a strong regular clientele but also popular with visitors to the theatre next-door, I had a wide range of responsibilities including SIBA and Carlsberg ordering and cellar maintenance, line-cleaning and so on. Beyond that I held the supplementary role of hospitality coach, which required attending monthly area meetings and presenting to the team the latest teaching about the guest experience in pubs.

### Pubwatchers UK

I previously had a role at Pubwatchers, a company that supplies services to breweries including security for pubs being refitted. At this job I learned the basics about pub infrastructure and the trade in general.

### The Co-operative Food and Morrisons

Prior to these jobs I have held jobs at these supermarkets with responsibilities including receiving deliveries and helping with stock management.

## Qualifications

I have a diploma in physics, awarded by the University of Southampton.

I also hold a personal licence and the BIIAB Award for Personal Licence Holders Level 2.
