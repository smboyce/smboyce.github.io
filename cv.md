I currently work at the Leopold Tavern, home to Southsea's greatest range of beers.

We have ten handpumps for traditional ale and also nine draught beers and ciders so naturally cellar management is a major factor. Our ale range changes twice weekly and we're also known for a wide array of craft bottles.

The Leopold doesn't stock the typical big brand lagers, nor do we sell shots and in doing so the pub has carved a distinct niche for itself in an area rich with pubs.

## Previous employment

### Spirit Pub Company

I have been a team leader at two Spirit pubs, the Thatched House and the Encore.

The Thatched House is a food-led establishment known as a family pub. Here I focused on bar training for the team and stock management. Ensuring compliance with relevant public safety legislation was also a responsibility. I achieved several 100% mystery guest visits on my shifts. With my help, the team focused on sales and guest satisfaction.

At the Encore, a drink-led pub with a strong regular clientele but also popular with visitors to the theatre next-door, I had a wide range of responsibilities including SIBA and Carlsberg ordering and cellar maintenance, line-cleaning and so on. Beyond that I held the supplementary role of hospitality coach, which required attending monthly area meetings and presenting to the team the latest teaching about the guest experience in pubs.

### Pubwatchers UK

I previously had a role at Pubwatchers, a company that supplies services to breweries including security for pubs being refitted. At this job I learned the basics about pub infrastructure and the trade in general.

### The Co-operative Food and Morrisons

Prior to these jobs I have held jobs at these supermarkets with responsibilities including receiving deliveries and helping with stock management.

## Qualifications

I have a diploma in physics, awarded by the University of Southampton.

I also hold a personal licence and the BIIAB Award for Personal Licence Holders Level 2.
