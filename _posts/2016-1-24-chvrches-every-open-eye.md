title: Album a day - Every Open Eye by Chvrches
---

The first album a friend said I should hear is by a group I know nothing about. Is it any good?

## An Album a Day

This is the second piece in my Album a Day series. It might be that in time I'll switch to weekly roundups rather than write a whole article about each album every day. If you have an idea for an album I might not have heard that deserves a listen, contact me somehow and let me know!

## Chvrches

Day two turned into Suggestion Saturday as a few lovely people chimed in with albums I should have a go on. I went with Chvrches - a group or artist I know absolutely nothing about. Here goes.

First impressions are that I've been suckered into wasting an hour on some pleasant but bland synth-pop. I can immediately see why Sami likes this with the vaguely uplifting chords and lyrics but it's not doing anything I like at first.

As the album goes on though I start hearing hints of things I love. This beat is so Gary Numan. That synth tone is totally Massive Attack. There are industrial rock elements too - at one point I imagine what Rammstein singer Till would have done with this tune or if synthy j-punkers Mad Capsule Markets would find some inspiration here.

Okay, but that's not to say it's a great record. Some songs completely pass me by and I wander if they played at all. There seems to be no real structure to the album but I guess that's the way things are now with YouTube and Spotify. And the elephant in the room is the vocals.

Let's not pretend here that the vocals aren't the descendent of the garbage euphoria trance of the early naughties. Remember that song “I need a miracle” or something? This girl has definitely heard that. It's all a bit vague and club friendly on the lyrics front and her voice sounds programmed by scientists to be as inoffensive as possible to people who've done too much.

I wouldn't have minded hating this, having the chance to really rip it to shreds would have been great. I don't dislike it though. There's potential for Chvrches to put out something really great building on what they've done here and I hope they do.
