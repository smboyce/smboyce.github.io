title: Bahrain Grand Prix - three thoughts
---

Certainly Bahrain didn't serve up the most exciting race ever but there is still some intrigue in the Mercedesâ€”Ferrari battle and also further down the grid.

## Rosberg, Rosberg, Rosberg

Last year's runner up has looked off colour so far this year but showed his mettle this time out with decisive moves on both red cars. Poor fortune relegated him to third but expect him to win again before long. I'm tempted to put a few quid on him for Spain.

## This year is a battle of the strategists

It's the battle of the geeks to see who will win the championships in 2015. Mercedes are faster over a lap but with race fuel and fragile Pirellis it's clear that Ferrari can bring the fight to them. Vettel and Hamilton have the points advantages over their teammates so far but I believe this could be a three or even four way battle after the European races.

##  For goodness sake, let them develop

What harm would a quick test and a few more engine tokens really do? Would it be worth the cost if it brought Red Bull and McLaren into contention for podiums? *Come on Bernie, give the fans what they want*
