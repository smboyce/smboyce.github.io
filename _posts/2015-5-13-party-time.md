Before the election, I kept hearing similar conversations, at work or out and about. In short, the low-waged buying into the newspaper/Conservative narrative that it is the rest of the lower class responsible for the financial situation of the country.

## On Benefits and BMW ownership

They didn't put it in quite those terms, of course. One colleague at a job I recently left remarked that he knew someone "on benefits who's just bought a Beemer" and everyone else nodded, knowingly. Before I get to the meat of this post, I just want to take a second to examine what this means.

On the face of it, a BMW is a luxury car and being a claiment of benefits is a situation where you're expected not to afford luxuries. Benefits can, as I'm sure we all know, include a range of things such as disability, child benefit, council tax, job-seekers' allowance and various other things.

So for all I know our BMW owner is disabled, looking for a job, a parent, or all three? In any of these situations I imagine purchasing a car makes sense. Quite a few jobs are available to the willing driver. For many people with disabilities, a safe and reliable means of transport is a lifeline. For parents the merits of a car are probably similarly obvious.

So what's the issue? Is it that this car is a BMW? Is a BMW too good for someone receiving financial assistance from the state? This seems to be what my former colleague was implying and everyone else seemed to accept.

Again, without really considering too hard we can imagine there might be good reasoning behind buying a BMW. Typically they are slightly more expensive than a comparable car of an alternative brand, but perhaps our person found a good deal? Maybe it was the best option for someone with a physical disability, perhaps in a wheelchair and needing a vehicle of specific dimensions. Maybe they had saved for it and it was a luxury they had budgeted for and simply felt they deserved in their life?

## A Vote for Envy

I want to say something unfashionable that I should have said to this young co-worker I knew. It's not up to everyone else how you spend your benefit money. The poor or out of work or disabled are still allowed to buy things that make them happy.

I shouldn't say this because some Tory will change it, but when you develop a disability or lose your job, no-one turns up to confiscate your non-essential possessions.
