title: Album a day - Bleach by Nirvana

I've a bit of a soft spot for Nirvana but never gave their debut a chance. Will it impress?

## An Album a Day

[This article](http://www.vox.com/2016/1/22/10806632/album-every-day) gave me the inspiration to try and listen to a new-to-me album every day remaining in 2016.

The plan is to theme the days of the week to provide some variety on a day to day basis and force me to explore and get out of my comfort zone. Yesterday was "Fun Friday" where I chose an album I know I'm likely to enjoy but for whatever reason have never listened to.

## Nirvana

I've always had a lot of admiration for Nirvana though I wouldn't describe them as one of my favourites. Nevermind is too polished production-wise for my tastes despite the presence of great songs such as Lithium and In Bloom. In Utero, on the other hand, beautifully captures Cobain's confusion and undirected anger and is for me one of the top thirty or so albums of all time.

Why have I never given Bleach a go? Well I always assumed it was one for the hardcore Nirvana fan, like how only a real Kyuss enthusiast would bother with Wretch, a category of which I don't consider myself a member. Time to plug in the AKGs and give it a spin.

## Bleach

The album kicks off with a real sense of enjoyment. Blew is a cracking tune and Cobain's guitar sounds reminiscent of Black Flag's Greg Ginn and the song ends in a manner reminding me of early Kyuss. It's not perfect, but it's lovable. It's followed straight up with an intro to the next song that I felt could have come from Sleep's Vol. 1. At this point I'm really regretting not giving this record a chance sooner. About a Girl is the only song I've heard before and is unique in its accessibility and radio-friendliness. It's easily the most developed song on the album - the only one that doesn't honestly sound like a demo.

School is another song that reminds me of early Kyuss - specifically the rhythm puts me in mind of Big Bikes which is a tune I just love. I'm also thinking about the DC hardcore band Wool when I hear this. Then comes Love Buzz which has this very Marmite bass bridge pickup tone I could probably have survived without ever hearing. The vocal performance on this track is standout though.

Paper Cuts is a song with a great grinding rhythm initialy but the vocal recording in the chorus is just awful and grates heavily. Then we get a bridge with basically palm muted scales on the guitar and I feel like I was making similar music at 16 and I knew it was dreadful then. Friends' bands when I was at college had a similar sort of sound. Sorry.

I'm increasingly feeling like this album is heavily front-loaded - all the best tracks were on side one and we're getting into territory I've no real interest in. Negative Creep is I'm sure a song I've heard at some alt night as a teenager in Plymouth and I probably even hated it then. Scoff follows the general downward trajectory of the album.

## Conclusions

It's probably fair to say this isn't a classic in anyone's book but there are some great moments here. Kurt and co didn't quite have an album's worth of good ideas at this point but you could see the direction they were heading in.

I'll probably never bother listening to the album all the way through like this again but perhaps there's room for a couple of tracks such as School on a playlist for me.

Tomorrow's record: undecided at the moment. I was thinking of going with Supergroup Saturday so any suggestions?
