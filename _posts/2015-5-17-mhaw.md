On this Mental Health Awareness Week I want to say something I haven't seen written about much in the blogs I follow or the newspapers I read.

Diagnosis is for many of us one of the toughest times in our lives. It's bloody scary, seeing doctor after doctor and being fed so many different pills and doing so many questionnaires to try and find the label that most approximates how your particular case can be defined.

## Before my diagnosis

In 2002 and 2003 I found I changed quite a lot. It was probably put down to puberty. I went from being a quiet, bookish, straight A kid who loved Tolkien and Magic the Gathering to suddenly having the shortest attention span and the worst behaviour. School suddenly turned into hell and when they made me turn up I would try and get kicked out. I had never really tried booze but I had constant cravings for something to calm me down and alcohol helped. It culminated in a day where I covered a room in extinguisher powder broke a window and started a fire on a bus.

I was hauled in to see the headmaster for the millionth time or thereabouts. I was suspended and he called me Rambo and said I would have to see a psychiatrist and it would go on my record and he hoped it would prevent me going to college and uni. The psychiatrist told me I should take up chess.

## Growing up

I took up playing bass instead. Disappointingly for Dr Pettit I did manage to go to college and things came together for a time. I was offered a place at every uni I applied to, including Downing College, Cambridge. My dream.

Things were starting to fall apart again and I never got to go to any of those universities, as a bout of depression over my final exams knocked me down in grades just a little too far for Cambridge or my backup Warwick. I ended up at Southampton and moved in to halls in October 2006.

## Meeting Mark

Dr Mark Edwards was to be my GP throughout the eight years I lived in Soton. I remember the first time I opened up to him, in January 2007, a wreck of a man. I was barely eating, just the odd toasted sandwich, and was drinking a hideous amount. I was in tears in the waiting room, hiding behind some massive sunglasses and hair below my shoulders.

Mark was the first person I'd ever known in my life that seemed to want to help me. My then girlfriend of three years had brought me to the GP and he seemed to give her a look that said "I'll take it from here." She left me that day and never looked back.

Mark had endless patience with me. I was a hypochondriac, constantly turning up thinking I had cancer. He knew all the right people at the various mental health services and how to get them to sit up and take notice rather than just go through the long-winded referral channels.

I remember some time in the spring of 2007 sitting in his room at the University surgery and describing how the latest pills weren't working, how I was sort of up quite a lot? "Why didn't you just tell me you were bipolar?" He sort of half-joked. I had no bloody idea I was bipolar. The weight lifted slightly knowing there was a word for it.

When I moved house in Southampton one of my first priorities was always to have an address within the area where I could keep Mark as my GP. I think my mum wrote to him once to thank him. She didn't know how I'd have survived without him and I don't either.

## Less of the life history, Simon

I could write a book about the experiences I've had with various doctors, probably so could anyone with mental health problems such as the psychosis and bipolar disorder I suffer with.

Behind every successful diagnosis is a good doctor. For me that doctor was Mark and I just wanted to say thank you with all my heart.
