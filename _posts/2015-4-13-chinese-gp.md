## Rosberg needs to refocus

Nico Rosberg's bizarre rant after his defeat in China shows a fragile personality seeking to place the blame elsewhere for his own shortcomings.

Rosberg is a driver with the potential to be great but he needs to recognise when he is beaten. Complaining about the speed at which Hamilton won the race looks pathetic (it is after all a race!) and won't endeer him to fans or the Merc management.

## Verstappen is a star

Max Verstappen, or to give him his full name, Young Max Verstappen, showed himself to be a master of late braking in China. Anyone who can pull off overtakes like that in such an underpowered car should be destined for greatness. Such a shame his Renault power unit couldn't go the distance. Remember Hamilton's GP2 year and his F1 rookie season? I am that excited about Max.

## Honda need rule flexibility

It does the sport no good to see legends McLaren roll around at the back of the field. Alonso is arguably the greatest driver since Schumacher and this is no way to see out his and Jenson Button's careers. Let Honda develop their power unit and let's see what these guys can do.
