## A fantastic evening of beer, cider and music

I was fortunate enough to negotiate a night off of work to attend the inaugral Southsea Beerex at the Wedgewood Rooms the other day.

The entertainment highlight for me was Steel Strum, a duo playing a range of recent hits and pop classics on a steel drum and an acoustic guitar.

I worked my way through firstly the stouts and then the more unusual ales while my partner took on the ciders. With brewers such as Staggeringly Good, Irving and Darkstar presenting their wares the choice was fantastic for a smaller beer fest.

Particularly enjoyable was the Milk Stout and the Black Forest stout, evidence that my tastes are changing. Both were notable for their mouth feel, the latter in particular very thick and rich on the tongue with a flavour Guinness would love the secret to.

My partner fell in love with Whisky Cask, a cider matured in, yes, you guessed it. It had all the delicate qualities of a fine wine, with a floral top note and subtle colour masking a real depth of flavour which only becomes apparent after further sipping. Wonderful stuff.

Real credit to these brewers and the organisers for arranging such a great event and producing such fantastic alcohol!
