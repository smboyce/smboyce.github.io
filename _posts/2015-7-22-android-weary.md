title: A month with Android Wear

Wearables feel like the future but after a month with an Android watch am I convinced?

## My watch

I chose a Moto 360 for my Android Wear device for a stack of reasons. I liked the way it looked, I mean it's certainly better than anything Sony or Samsung have to offer in my eyes. I trusted Motorola to deliver the sort of quietly functional tech I like. My phone is a Moto G and my laptop is built by (Motorola's new parent company) Lenovo and they both have that feel of discreet quality about them. Finally, the price. I could just about afford it (rival products would have been more of a stretch) and so I grabbed one.

In case you've not seen a Moto 360, it has a round face, albeit with a slither across that bottom where the sensors are which isn't part of the screen, and reassuringly chunky strap and chassis. There's a single button where you'd adjust the time of a traditional watch and it has a pleasingly firm click to it when you press it. On the underside of the watch is a pulse sensor which sometimes lights up green.

It's a bit fatter than you might hope, in fact getting a sleeve over it can be an issue with tighter cuffs. I have particularly thin wrists and it looks sort of like I'm wearing one of those electronic tags they strap to people with ASBOs.

In an attempt to save battery (the life of which is predictably pathetic) the screen is off until triggered by arm motion. This means any time you want to check your watch you have to very deliberately lift your arm and so you will always look like you're trying to show the thing off.

You can change the watch face and many people have designed there own so there's a whole load of them out there on the internet, many displaying date and weather information as well as the basic time. I have one by someone called Kevin Tong which shows various robots holding up a sign displaying the digital time. Nice.

## Android Wear and apps

Android Wear has a handy tutorial when you first use your smartwatch which is handy because I had no bloody idea how the thing worked when I got it. It does quickly become second nature to swipe away notifications, pull up the things you're interested in, tap to display your apps list etc. If you haven't used your watch much it will prompt you to use the voice command "Okay Google" a few times. You can scroll through notifications by gesture, sort of flicking your wrist away and back.

Google has clearly thought long and hard about what information people want on their wrists and concluded it must be the temperature and how much you've moved that day so far. I don't know how to stop the thing informing me of the weather as frankly it's something I don't much care about generally. It's vaguely interesting when it tells me I've walked however many steps that day but as I don't wear it for work the figure is of little relevance.

Maps, on the other hand, I love. It's bloody fantastic being able to quickly see where you are and was very handy on a recent cycling trip. The maps are probably my single favourite feature. I love getting out and about and not having to consult my phone for directions feels luxurious.

## Ingress

Google's massive augmented reality game Ingress was the thing I was most excited about when it was *finally* released for Wear. It's good but not great. The best thing about it is probably being able to hack portals without looking too antisocial but the crucial glyph minigame isn't a feature the watch version has at the moment. No matter. I said it's not great but actually I do love Ingress on Wear despite its many flaws. I may write a comprehensive review of it in coming days. Suffice to say if you have a watch and are looking to see what can be done with it, Ingress is interesting. If you play Ingress but don't want an Android watch for other reasons, there's nothing exciting enough to go and get one yet.

## How it makes me feel

The life of an Android wearer is a strange one. You want to get the use out of it but you don't want to look like a total dork. You forget you're wearing it and check your phone anyway even though the point of the thing is really to keep the phone in your pocket. You forget to wear it and look really silly making the characteristic swing to your face the device requires to detect that it's time to illuminate the screen. The battery runs out and you have this big heavy useless thing strapped to you.

You're probably thinking it hasn't really improved my day to day. Maybe it hasn't. I feel like it's my fault that I'm not getting the maximum functionality out of it. I've been in the habit of periodically pulling my phone out of my pocket to check for messages for more than half my life. It is liberating to feel that subtle buzz on your wrist, in an odd way. Can you tell it's really hard to put in to words how Android Wear feels?

## Could I live without it now?

If suddenly I was in more major financial struggles than usual, the watch would be the first thing to go. It's a silly luxury item and it has so much wrong with it I can barely explain. When the crisis was over and I had the cash, would I buy another? Absolutely.
