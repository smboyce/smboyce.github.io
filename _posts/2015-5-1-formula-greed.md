title: Formula Greed and the cost of supporting single-seaters
---

Bernie doesn't want everyone to watch Formula One - he's after a particular demographic. Where is the racing for fans on a budget?

## Formula 1 isn't for me

I'm not about to buy a Rolex or a Mercedes or an LG television or even a Sky Sports subscription. If I need an energy boost then Emerge or KX or whatever the cheap Red Bull alternative in whatever supermarket I'm in will do just fine.

In fact I can't think of a current sponsor of F1 or any team or driver whose product I ever buy. I'm just not the right demographic - which makes sense because F1 is a bit of a luxury sport, not participated in or particularly aimed at the working class person.

## This leaves a gap in the market

Probably I'm not the only person increasingly frustrated with this and other aspects of F1. Tickets and TV subscriptions for the grand prix are priced much higher than I can really justify. Ferrari, Mercedes, McLaren et cetera are not brands I feel I can relate to. The drivers are (I believe without exception) born at least relatively wealthy and far removed from the world as we live it.

Is it possible for there to be a single-seater or even sports car class that doesn't have these sorts of issues? After all, with the enormous cost of developing and operating an F1 car it's always going to be a big money game.

##  Isn't this where E could fit in?

Formula E is still in the process of establishing a niche. Obviously they want it to be a testbed for electric vehicle technology, at the same time couldn't they aim to be an open-wheel formula for the masses? After all, who's more worried about the rising cost of petrol? *Not those with a Rolex...*

For me, E is doing a lot of things right. Starting out with spec cars to get the infrastructure in place before the teams become constructors. Using the internet like IndyCar and Nascar do to involve fans. Online streaming of races. Free grandstand tickets to the Long Beach ePrix was also a great move. But the high price of general admission and "viewing platform" premium standing tickets for London smacks of complacency.

I don't work in motorsport or in marketing. Maybe smarter folks than I know what they're doing with this Battersea Park race. I do know I'm not paying more for one FE race than I would for a whole day of racing at TOCA, particularly when it's all standing at a pretty flat park and being on a platform is extra!

It would be great for this new series to be a success and maybe upset the status quo in formula racing. I'll keep watching, just not in person this year at least.
