Peer pressure and the PM

The allegations regarding David Cameron's time at university are a source of plenty of jokes on Twitter today but the reality behind the headlines is much more serious.

We all have friends who are, frankly, idiots. When I was at uni I knew plenty of people who would down that dirty pint or expose their genitals in a nightclub or generally make a twat of themself so they would be seen as "one of the lads" and accepted by their peers. I'm sure you know someone who acted like this as a student.

There are occasions where these things can go too far. Bad taste socials by sports teams often push the boundaries. Fortunately, most of us aren't judged by our behaviour or lack of judgement as a student for the rest of our lives.

These Oxford drinking societies, of which the current prime minister was a member, shouldn't really be an exception. I can understand there would be some pressure as someone young and wealthy and expensively educated to be "that guy" at parties and perhaps it's best to keep them all together and hope some maturity eventually occurs. David Cameron is married, has children, presumably isn't the same idiot we see in the infamous Bullingdon club photos of the 1980s.

Cameron, though, has surrounded himself in adult life with his Eton and Oxford contemporaries. Boris Johnson. George Osbourne. Others whose names I can't think of right now. People that have known both Davids - the immature hard-drinker and scourge of Oxford waiters and the David that now leads our country. People that have seen him at his worst.

If the Ashcroft allegations are accurate, someone close to David Cameron has a photo of the PM in a compromising position with a deceased pig. If that were you, what would you do to prevent this becoming widely circulated? Probably pretty much anything...

Cameron's team, many of whom he has known for many years, may well have access to this image. It may be that he has similar dirt on them. We have a prime minister who was a sucker for peer pressure, that desire to be one of the gang at all costs, and a government of his friends from that time.

I don't honestly care that the PM used to be a bit of a jerk when he was a student. It does, however, concern me that there could be people with sufficient material on him to compromise whatever integrity he has. Ashcroft clearly has a bad case of sour grapes, forget him. If you want something to be concerned about, look at where the PM's old school and uni buddies are now, consider whether pig-fucking may not be the worst thing they have to scare him with and think about what you would do to protect your position were you in such a situation.
